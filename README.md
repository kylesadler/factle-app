Boilerplate code for starter website

## Testing Environment

1. Install the JS package manager `npm`.
2. From the main directory, run `npm i` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the frontend (use `npm run build-debug` to build with debugging). You'll need to run this everytime you make changes to the frontend.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server on `localhost:8080`.
